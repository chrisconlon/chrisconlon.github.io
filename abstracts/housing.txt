Most theories of consumption predict that consumers respond to recessions by "downshifting" their consumption from high quality to lower 
quality goods. Much of the evidence comes from the behavior of individual consumers using supermarket scanner data. We show that firms 
may want to increase product quality during a recession if consumers observe historical prices and form expectations about future 
prices, but cannot perfectly observe historical quality. This effect should be largest for firms with a large number of units to sell in 
future periods. We apply our model to data from the real estate market. We show that during the Great Recession this strategy was 
employed by real-estate development firms. Rather than cutting prices, firms invested in the quality of housing units in order to 
provide more value to consumers, and simultaneously limit price declines. We also show that firms with a larger stock of units to sell 
in the future were more likely to improve quality in response to negative demand shocks. For durable goods, this provides an alternate 
to menu costs as a micro-founded mechanism for generating sticky prices.
