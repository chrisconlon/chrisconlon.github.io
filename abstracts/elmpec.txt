The Empirical Likelihood (EL) estimator, and the family of related Generalized Empirical Likelihood (GEL) estimators provide a number of potential advantages when compared to Generalized Method of 
Moments (GMM) estimators. While it is well known these estimators share an asymptotic distribution, the EL estimator is higher order efficient and may perform better in finite sample. A relatively 
new literature has documented that finite-sample bias in the demand estimation problem of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) may in cases be quite large, especially as the number of products 
increases, or the instrumental variables become correlated. This paper provides a formulation for a computationally tractable EL estimator based on the MPEC method of Su and Judd (2012) and adapts 
it to the BLP problem. When compared to GMM approaches, the EL estimator performs substantially better in finite-sample, reducing the bias by as much as 30%.
