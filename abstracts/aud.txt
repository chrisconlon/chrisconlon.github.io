Many vertically-separated markets are characterized by common agency, in which competing upstream firms sell products through a common downstream agent. The downstream agent may provide ancillary 
services or exert effort in order to sell products, and non-exclusive agency may result in an under-provision of these services from the point of view of an upstream firm. If so, an upstream firm 
may try to align the down- stream firms incentives to provide increased effort through contractual arrangements such as quantity discounts, rebate contracts, or exclusive dealing. These arrangements 
may also have anti-competitive effects by crowding out the products of competing man- ufacturers. We examine a particular vertical rebate, an all-units-discount. Under this contract, the downstream 
firm pays a linear wholesale price until a target quantity is met. Once that target quantity is met, a discount applies not only to all future units purchased, but also to all previous units. This 
has the effect that the marginal cost to the agent is effectively negative over parts of the curve, which might appear hard to justify in the absence of anti-competitive reasons. The tension between 
the efficiency-enhancing and anti-competitive effects provides the motivation for empirical work.
