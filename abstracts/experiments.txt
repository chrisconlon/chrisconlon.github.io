Product availability impacts many industries such as transportation, events, and retail, yet little empirical evidence documents the importance of stocking decisions 
for firm profits, vertical relationships, or consumers. We conduct several experiments, ex- ogenously removing top-selling products from a set of vending machines and 
analyzing substitution patterns and profit impacts of the changed product availability using non- parametric analyses and structural demand estimation. We find 
substantial switching to alternate products, and evidence of misaligned incentives between upstream and downstream firms in the choice of which products to carry. We 
discuss the trade-offs of both empirical approaches for analyzing product availability effects generally.
