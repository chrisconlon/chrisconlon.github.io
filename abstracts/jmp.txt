Televisions represent an important aspect of consumer spending, and for many households, represent one of the largest single-ticket consumer purchases. Within the television 
industry, LCD flat-panel displays comprise over 80% of the overall TV marketshare in 2008, and represent the dominant format among consumer television sales. A unique 
feature of the LCD manufacturing process is that most TV’s consist of only a few components, and the majority of the cost (and overwhelming majority of cost variation) is 
the panel itself. I use a unique dataset on LCD manufacturing costs to understand how margins change over time. This enables me to test different assumptions about how firms 
set prices in this industry, rather than having to make ex ante assumptions about the markups charged by firms.

I make use of a dataset provided by NPD DisplaySearch, which tracks sales of LCD TV’s from early 2006 to the present. During this time period, both prices and manufacturer 
input costs fall substantially. I adapt the model of Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2009) which extends the static demand model of Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995) to the case 
where heterogeneous consumers treat products as durable goods. In other words, consumers face choices between purchasing products today and waiting until a later period when 
products are likely to be of higher quality and less expensive to consumers.  Better data on input costs and a novel methodology (developed in the second chapter of my 
dissertation) allow me to test assumptions about equilibrium behavior, and attribute the extent to which price changes are due to a number of factors including: 
inter-temporal price discrimination, forward-looking consumers, falling costs, and increased entry and competition. I accomplish this by making different assumptions about 
firms’ price setting behavior and re-compute markups using the observed cost data.
