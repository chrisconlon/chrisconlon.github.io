For retail and service firms, distribution is often the paramount concern of the company. One of the most critical distribution activities that retail and service firms 
engage in is the efficient management of inventories. Innovations in inventory management, such as the widespread adoption of radio frequency identification tags (RFID) by 
major retailers, have put the spotlight on these production processes. In our research, we seek to answer the question, what are the benefits of innovation in inventory 
monitoring information technology?

By making use of a “natural-experiment” at a vending machine operator, we find two important benefits to wireless inventory management.  The first is that by pre-picking 
products for fast delivery at the retail location technology may reduce restocking times by 20-30%.  This enables the firm to substitute less expensive (low-skill) warehouse 
labor for more expensive (high-skill) driver labor. The second impact is that the technology provides better information on stock-outs and inventory levels. This allows the 
firm to reduce the average frequency with which they restock machines. However, we find that when the firm does restock, the inventory level lies within a tighter band. In 
other words, because they are better able to respond to demand shocks and stock-outs, the firm is able to service the machines less often.
